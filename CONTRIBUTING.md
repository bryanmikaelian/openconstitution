This is an experiment to see how ratification of the constitution would work if it was pull request based.

This repo's README can only be changed by an amendment process i.e. pull requests. 

To get the process started:

1. Open a Pull Request with your amendment name in the title and your changes to the README. For example: "Equal Rights Amendment". You can leave off the next amendment # (i.e. 28) from your title if you want
2. Use the pull request to present your case and discuss / debate the amendment.
3. A respective milestone and deadline will be associated to the pull request. For starters, we'll try a 1 month deadline.
4. Once the deadline passes, the pull requested will merged if the +1 to -1 ratio > 3/4ths or 75%. For example, an pull request with 75 +1s and 25 -1s would be merged (ratified) but an amendment with 75 -1s and 25 +1s would not.
5. Merged PRs will be labeled as "Ratified". Unmerged PRs will be labeled as "Failed".

NOTE: This document can receive Pull Requests like normal
