# Contributing

Much like the real US Constitution, this repo's README can only be changed by an amendment process. However, in this case, amendments are pull requests. Let's see what happens during this experience. 

To get the process starte;

1. Open a Pull Request with your amendment name in the title. For example: "Equal Rights Amendment".
2. Use the pull request to discuss / debate the amendment.
3. A respective milestone and deadline will be associated to the pull request. For starters, we'll try a 1 month deadline.
4. Once the deadline passes, the pull requested will merged if the +1 to -1 ratio > 3/4ths or 75%. For example, an pull request with 75 +1s and 25 -1s would be merged (ratified) but an amendment with 75 -1s and 25 +1s would not.
5. Merged PRs will be labeled as "Ratified". Unmerged PRs will be labeled as "Failed".

NOTE: This document can receive Pull Requests like normal
